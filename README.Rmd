```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.path = "Figures/README-"
)
```

# Load library
```{r, warning = F, message = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
```

# Load data

```{r}
data <- read_csv("./data/master.csv")
data <- data %>% rename(HDI = `HDI for year`)
```

Have a look
```{r}
summary(data)
```

- country-year column is just a concatenation of country and year column

- suicides/100k pop is calculated by suicides / population * 100000

- HDI is Human Development Report, seems missing alot, the only variable is missing

- Age is divided into brackets

```{r}
skim(data)
```

There are:

- 6 Age brackets

- 101 differenet countries in this data set

- Year from 1985 to 2016. (32 years)

- 2321 combinations of country-year (less than 32 * 101). Must be some implicit missing data 

-
